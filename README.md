## Project Overview

### Objective

- Create an automated system for showcasing GitHub repositories in an organized and filterable interface
- Solve the challenge of portfolio presentation for developers who maintain multiple projects
- Implement continuous deployment to eliminate manual updates when new repositories are created

### Executive Summary
GitHub RepoHub Showcase is a dynamic web application that automatically generates an elegant portfolio of GitHub repositories. It leverages the GitHub API to fetch repository data, transforms it into a responsive HTML interface, and deploys it to GitHub Pages through automated CI/CD workflows. The system features technology-based filtering, theme customization, and blog integration, making it an ideal solution for developers, teams, and organizations wanting to showcase their projects effectively.

## Architecture
The application follows a serverless architecture with GitHub Pages hosting the static frontend. The backend processing occurs during the CI/CD pipeline execution, where Python scripts fetch repository data and generate the HTML content.

### Component Breakdown
- **Data Retrieval**: Python script connects to GitHub API to fetch repository information
- **HTML Generation**: Repository data is processed and converted into an interactive HTML page
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow automates the build and deployment process
- **Static Hosting**: GitHub Pages serves the generated content with no additional infrastructure required
- **Client-Side Processing**: JavaScript handles filtering, searching, and theme switching on the user's browser

## Technologies Used

|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Backend         | Python 3.8+                           |
| Frontend        | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript               |
| APIs            | GitHub REST API                       |
| CI/CD           | GitHub Actions                        |
| Deployment      | GitHub Pages                          |

## Project Structure
```
myGH-showcase/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                        # Core logic for fetching repos and generating HTML
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt               # Python dependencies (requests)
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html                     # Generated output (not in repository)
â””â”€â”€ .github/
    â”œâ”€â”€ PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md   # Template for contributions
    â””â”€â”€ workflows/
        â””â”€â”€ deploy.yml             # GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
```

### Folder Purpose Explanation
- `main.py`: Contains the core application logic for API interaction and HTML generation
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies required for the application
- `.github/workflows/`: Contains CI/CD pipeline configurations for automated deployment
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: Standardizes contribution format for project maintainability

##  Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8+ for local development
- Git for version control
- GitHub account for repository access and GitHub Pages hosting

### Credentials Needed

- Repository owner permissions for enabling GitHub Pages
- Write permissions to the repository for CI/CD workflow execution

## Installation

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vsingh55/myGH-showcase.git
cd myGH-showcase

# Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install package in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run the generator locally
python -m github_showcase

# Preview the generated site
python -m http.server 8000  # Access at http://localhost:8000
```

### Setting Up Your Own Website

After testing locally, follow these steps to set up your own GitHub Pages website:

1. **Fork and Clone**:
   ```bash
   # Fork this repository on GitHub
   # Then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/myGH-showcase.git
   cd myGH-showcase
   ```

2. **Update Configuration**:
   - Edit `src/github_showcase/config/settings.py`:
     ```python
     GITHUB_USERNAME = "your-username"  # Your GitHub username
     EXCLUDE_REPOS = []  # Add repositories to exclude
     BLOG_BASE_URL = "your-blog-url"  # Your blog URL (optional)
     TECH_FILTERS = ["your", "tech", "stack"]  # Your technology stack
     ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository's Settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" in the sidebar
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"

4. **Set Up Custom Domain** (Optional):
   - In repository Settings â†’ Pages
   - Add your custom domain
   - Update `cname` in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
     ```yaml
     cname: your-domain.com
     ```

5. **Push Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure for my website"
   git push origin main
   ```

6. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Wait for GitHub Actions to complete
   - Your site will be available at:
     - `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/myGH-showcase/` (default)
     - `https://your-domain.com` (if using custom domain)

**Note**: The first deployment might take a few minutes. You can monitor the progress in the "Actions" tab of your repository.

## Configuration
The application can be configured by modifying the variables in `main.py`:

```python
# Configuration
GITHUB_USERNAME = "your-username"  # Set to your GitHub username
EXCLUDE_REPOS = ["repos-to-exclude"]  # Repositories to exclude from display
BLOG_BASE_URL = "https://yourblog.com"  # Base URL for blog integration
TECH_FILTERS = [  # Technologies for filtering system
    "azure", "aws", "python", "kubernetes", 
    # Add or remove technologies as needed
]
```

## Deployment
Deployment is fully automated through GitHub Actions. The workflow is configured in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Fork or clone the repository
   - Update configuration variables in `main.py`
   - Push changes to the main branch

2. **Automated Process**:
   - GitHub Actions workflow is triggered on push to main branch
   - Python environment is set up with required dependencies
   - `main.py` is executed to generate `index.html`
   - Generated content is published to GitHub Pages branch

3. **Verification**:
   - After successful deployment, the site is available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`
   - Check GitHub Actions logs for any deployment issues

### Access Information

- The showcase is publicly accessible with no authentication required
- Repository links direct to the corresponding GitHub repositories
- Blog links connect to associated technical articles (if configured)
- Website links connect to associated pages (if configured). I have configured website link with the links of my project listed on my portfolio.

## Performance Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Automation Efficiency**: Eliminates manual portfolio updates
- **Search Optimization**: Provides instant filtering across all repositories
- **Deployment Speed**: GitHub Actions pipeline completes in less than 30 seconds.
- **Page Load Performance**: Static hosting ensures fast load times (<1s on broadband)
- **Content Freshness**: Automatically incorporates newly created repositories

## Security Considerations

- GitHub API token should be stored as a repository secret, not hardcoded if needed
- The application only accesses public repository data
- No user data is collected or stored during browsing
- Content Security Policy considerations for GitHub Pages hosting
- Regular dependency updates to address potential vulnerabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **API Rate Limiting**: If encountering GitHub API rate limits, configure with a personal access token
- **Missing Repositories**: Verify repository visibility settings and check exclusion list
- **Deployment Failures**: Check GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages
- **Local Testing Issues**: Ensure Python version compatibility and proper dependency installation
- **Contact Support**: For additional assistance, contact vscit23@gmail.com
